Hi, guys!
This post is about what I did on the 2nd week of the coding period for Google Summer of Code 2017.

This week I worked for supporting `vars` and `consts` by CFFI backend engine.
Go has the concept of `const` and `vars`, but since Python does not have a 1: 1 equivalent concept so
gopy provides a Get / Set function to make it available.
If you want to know more about them. Please read this [link](https://gobyexample.com/constants).

Anyway, to provide this features by CFFI engine, I wrote codes to generate get/set functions by using CFFI.
Also, I added the unit test codes for checking these features are working well.
Here is a list of unit tests which are supported by CFFI engine.

* [empty.go](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/empty/empty.go)
* [cgo.go](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/cgo/cgo.go)
* [vars.go](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/vars/vars.go) 
* [consts.go](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/consts/consts.go)   
* [simple.go](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/simple/simple.go) 

Finally, I submitted [the pull request](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/pull/98).
Sebastien requested me to add doc strings for the Get/Set functions, So I added them.
And then, my PR was merged into the code base. :)

Now you can use `consts` and `vars` concepts on the PyPy and Python3.
Here is the example.

`````
[PyPy 5.1.2 with GCC 5.3.1 20160413] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>> import vars
>>>> dir(vars)
['GetKind1', 'GetKind2', 'GetV1', 'GetV2', 'GetV3', 'GetV4', 'GetV5', 'GetV6', 'GetV7', 'SetKind1', 
'SetKind2', 'SetV1', 'SetV2', 'SetV3', 'SetV4', 'SetV5', 'SetV6', 'SetV7', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc
__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', '_cffi_backend', '_cffi_helper', 'ffi', 'os']
>>>> v1 = vars.GetV1()
>>>> v1
'v1'
>>>> vars.SetV1("new v1")
>>>> v1 = vars.GetV1()
>>>> v1
'new v1'

`````

On the week3, I worked on [**gencffi: Detect functions returning a Go error**](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/pull/105). I will talk about it in the next post.
Thank you.

**Happy hacking**
