Hi, all!

I am really happy to write this post.  
For last 2 months, I spent my whole times for writing proposals of Google Summer of Code 2017 (aka GSoC 2017) this year.  

![GSoC2017Accepted](/images/proposal_accepted.png)
On May 5th, 2017, **projects which accepted for Google Summer of Code 2017 were [announced](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/)**. And **one of my proposals was accepted!**

As the result, Sebastien Binet and Alexandre Claude are my mentors and I will work for **gopy@CERN-HSF** this summer.
So I am going to write blog posts during GSoC 2017 periods.

Here is [the link of my proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ndokjukbx0Kg2SMm_SEvomkojHnI-QRb7B8q9yntEIc/edit?usp=sharing).

Now is community bonding period, I am going to review my proposal and set up a milestone, then plan to do a simple commit to get used to the gopy code base.

If you are interested in gopy project. Please visit [gopy repository](https://github.com/go-python/gopy) and ask anything! 
Any interest about gopy project is always welcome.

### Q: What is gopy?
> A: gopy is a Go command, modeled after the gomobile one. gopy generates (and compiles) a Python extension module from a go package. This project is expected to help improve performance for the Python package used in CERN.

### Q: What will you do during Google Summer Of Code 2017?
> A: My goal is to provide APIs for various Python compiler versions, such as CPython 2/3 and PyPy. This can be improved with CFFI or ctypes. Moreover, many goâ€™s implementations/features are not yet implemented in gopy. So this need to be implemented implementations such as slices, interfaces, and maps in the go. and write detailed documents(both in English and Korean!) as guideline introducing the basic concepts of gopy and how everything works under the hood. The goal of these documents would be to help newcomers quickly create Python extension modules from their existing Go packages.


**Happy hacking this summer!**
