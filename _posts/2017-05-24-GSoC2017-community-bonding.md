Hi, all!
Today I am writing about the community bonding period.
For last 1 months, I spent my whole times to boot up gopy project by using my proposal which I wrote.

This period is called **‘Community bonding’** by GSoC terms.
During this period, Every student meet their mentors and discuss their project.
In this period, start coding is not a necessary thing. 
So in my case, I read all the gopy code bases.
Through this process, I could design my proposal more concrete.
And then I analyzed which code will be generated by cffi and ctypes. So I found pros and cons of cffi case and ctypes case. I discussed cons of cffi with Sebastien. and then I got some solutions from him.

Next step was fixing or implementing simple issues.
When starting a new open-source project, IMHO fixing or implementing simple issues is best-practice.
Fortunately, one of my mentors, [Sebastien Binet](https://github.com/sbinet) provided [**a simple issue**](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/issues/85) for me.

I began to implement this issue. Just after a few days later, I submitted my patch through GitHub. and reviewed my patch by my mentor. Through code review process, I fixed my approach and code styles. Thanks to this process, I can feel more comfortable about gopy codebase.

Here is the result of the patch.

And I am now working on [**gopy,bind: add boilerplate code for cffi support**](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/issues/87). This issue is the main starting point of my summer project. I will talk about this issue later.

**Happy hacking this summer!**
