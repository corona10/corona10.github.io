Hi, guys!
This post is about what I did for on the 3rd week of the coding period at Google Summer of Code 2017.

I worked on [*detecting errors from functions and returning a Go error by handling them in a pythonic way.*](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/issues/104) Go handles an abnormal state by returning error values. This is the pretty straightforward way of handling errors. And this is the feature which gopy should provide.

So `gopy`'s strategy of supporting this features is very simple. If cgo function return values include an error which is not null then `gopy` raises `RuntimeError`.

And I wrote implementations of this strategy for the CFFI engine.
Finally, I submitted a pull request and got some feedback from Sebastien and then [the pull request was merged!](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/pull/105), now we can use this feature on PyPy and CPython3.

Here is the example.
I tested [pyerrors.go](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/pyerrors/pyerrors.go) and run it on the PyPy with a [test.py](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/pyerrors/test.py).

````

Divide by zero.
pyerrors.Div(5, 2) = 2
````

**CFFI engine succeeded to detection error!**
On the week 4, I worked on [**cffi: Support struct types**](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/issues/106).
I will talk about it in the next post.

Thank you.

**Happy hacking**
