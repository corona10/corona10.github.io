Hi, all!
This post is about what I did for on 7th week of the coding period at Google Summer of Code 2017.

For this week, I worked on [**cffi: Support named type + Pass 'seq.go' test**](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/issues/121). There are two useful types for Go. One is a named type and the other one is an unnamed type. So supporting this types is very important to use this types on Python through gopy.

My approach was generating a Python class for each of named types and generating method protocols for each of named types. Also, I worked for supporting `__add__` protocols for a slice type to pass a `seqs.go` test.

After my work was merged, CFFI engine of gopy could pass [`seqs.go`](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/seqs/seqs.go) test and [`named.go`](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/blob/master/_examples/named/named.go) test.

On the week 8, I worked on [**cffi: Support unnamed types and pass hi.go**](https://github.com/go-python/gopy/pull/123).
I will talk about it in the next post.

Thank you.

**Happy hacking**
